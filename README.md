# Number classification&addition using CNNs & RNNs

The first part is a small analysis on the dataset and a data generator. Next you can find my first model which predicts numbers using a combination of digits from MNIST dataset which range from 0 to 255.
Secondly you can find a number addition model which uses RNNs. RNNs are usefull here due to their capabilities to hold back data from previous states.

## Packages used

Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib
